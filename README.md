# Python Training

## Project installation with PyCharm

1. Clone the repository inside `PycharmProjects` directory:

    ```shell
    cd ~/PycharmProjects/
    git clone https://github.com/iuliachiriac/python-training-oct2023
    ```

1. Open PyCharm, go to `File` -> `Open` and select the `python-training-oct2023` directory.
1. In PyCharm, go to `Preferences/Settings` -> `Project:python-training-oct2023` -> `Project Interpreter`
1. Click on the settings icon -> `Add` -> `+` icon.
1. Select `Virtualenv Environment` -> check `New environment` and make sure Python3 installation path is correctly selected under `Base interpreter` -> `Ok`.
1. After the virtual environment is created, go to `Terminal` tab. The virtual environment should be activated (you should see `(venv)` before the usual prompt).

1. Install the requirements:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook server:

    ```shell
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Project installation without PyCharm

1. Clone the repository:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/iuliachiriac/python-training-oct2023
    ```

1. Move to project directory:
    ```shell
    cd python-training-oct2023-2
    ```

1. Create a virtual environment:

    ```shell
    virtualenv venv
    ```

1. Activate virtual environment:

    Linux/MacOS:
    ```shell
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Windows:
    ```shell
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

1. Install the requirements:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook server:

    ```shell
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Getting solutions
After each day solutions will be submitted to this repo.
Since you've been working on your exercises and maybe altered files in the repo directory, use the following in a terminal, in the repo directory:

```shell
# forget unwanted changes in docs
git checkout -- docs/
# save your changes
git stash
# get the updates
git pull
# restore your changes
git stash pop
```
