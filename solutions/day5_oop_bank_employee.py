# Make the argument balance of the __init__ an optional argument with default value 0
# Override the dunder method __str__ so that we can print bank objects more easily. Make it tell us the bank name and balance. Make __repr__ do the same thing.
# Make balance an _ attribute to suggest it is protected. Make balance a property in order to return it. Update deposit and withdaw to use _balance
