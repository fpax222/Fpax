    "  # Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a programming paradigm which provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. OOP models real-world entities as software objects, which have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes and Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something. It’s important to note that in most OOP languages a class just provides structure—it’s a blueprint for how something should be defined, but it doesn’t actually provide any real content itself. In Python however, classes also have a real content (the _class object_) and all the objects created from that class, aka _instance objects_ will fallback to their common _class object_ for the attributes not found directly on them\n",
    "\n",
    "While the *class* is the blueprint, an *instance* is a copy of the class with *actual* values, literally an object created out of a specific class, that we consider _it belongs_, (_is a_ relationship) to that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the class\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest definition for a class consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* keyword `class`\n",
    "* the name of the class (usually camel-cased)\n",
    "* an optional docstring\n",
    "* the body of the class"
