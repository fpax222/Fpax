    "# Testing your code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why should we test code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing your code is a very important step in the release cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it important?\n",
    "1. Until you execute a line of code, you don't know if that line can work at all.\n",
    "1. Until you execute your code with a representative set of basic use cases, you don't know if the code can work end-to-end.\n",
    "1. If you and possibly other people are going to modify your code, it's very easy to break it in unexpected ways. A suite of automated unit and integration tests gives you confidence you've not broken anything significant.\n",
    "1. Tests can be used for profiling, to help you understand changes in your system's performance, and raise a flag if something degrades significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of testing\n",
    "\n",
    "For any software application, both unit testing, as well as integration testing, is very important as each of them employs a unique process to test a software application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit testing** means testing individual modules of an application in isolation (without any interaction with dependencies) to confirm that those pieces of code are doing things right. **Integration testing** means checking if different modules are working fine when combined together as a group\n",
    "\n",
    "There are all kinds of tests besides integration and unit tests, and they're all important.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regression tests, to make sure no bugs have recurred.\n",
    "* Performance tests against various workloads, to characterize and guide improvement of performance.\n",
    "* Stress tests to make sure the software can handle high loads, and work on a busy system.\n",
    "* Resource tests, both to ensure resource consumption isn't unreasonable, and to ensure the code works as expected under low resource conditions.\n",
    "* Change testing, for example when the IP address changes, the time is changed on the box, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing frameworks (`unittest`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `unittest` module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and running tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, unittest supports some important concepts in an object-oriented way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **test fixture**\n",
    "A test fixture represents the preparation needed to perform one or more tests, and any associate cleanup actions. This may involve, for example, creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, or starting a server process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **test case**\n",
    "A test case is the individual unit of testing. It checks for a specific response to a particular set of inputs. unittest provides a base class, TestCase, which may be used to create new test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **test suite**\n",
    "A test suite is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both. It is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **test runner**\n",
    "A test runner is a component which orchestrates the execution of tests and provides the outcome to the user. The runner may use a graphical interface, a textual interface, or return a special value to indicate the results of executing the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The building block of a test is the test case. With `unittest`, you can create\n",
    "a test case by subclassing the `unittest.TestCase` class. Each method starting\n",
    "with `test` will be an individual testing scenario. Test methods should contain\n",
    "at least one `assert*` method call as this is the essential role of a test:\n",
    "comparing actual results agaist expected results.\n",
