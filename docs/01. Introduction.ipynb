    "# Introduction\n",
    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was conceived in the late 1980s, with its implementation being started in December 1989 by **Guido van Rossum**. It was named after the BBC TV show \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 2.0** was released on October 16, 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python 3.0** was released on December 3, 2008. It was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 2.7's end-of-life date was January 1, 2020; as of this date no new bug reports, fixes or changes are made to Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key features of the language\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreted\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike compiled languages , an interpreted language's translation doesn't happen beforehand. Translation occurs at the same time as the program is being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term *interpreted* or *compiled* is not a property of the language but a property of the implementation. Python program runs directly from the source code. So, Python will fall under *byte code interpreted*. The `.py` source code is first compiled to byte code as `.pyc`. This byte code can be interpreted (official *CPython* implementation), or JIT compiled (*PyPy* implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### High level\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the basic principle of coding, the factor that makes a language high level is its distance from machine binary code. How many layers of code the language is away from the machine’s simple 0s and 1s is what practically decides the level of any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other languages turn into Assembly when compiled, and run directly in the processor. Hence, being an interpreted language, which is not subject to processor, makes Python a high-level language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Python offers convenience of code readability — which makes the syntax of the program much easier and shorter, resulting in less coding steps for developers than imposed by Java or C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// C code\n",
    "if (1 == 2 || 1 == 0) {\n",
    "    printf(\"This is absurd!\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# python code\n",
    "if 1 is 2 or True is False:\n",
    "    print(\"This is absurd!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamically typed\n",
    "\n",
    "In statically typed languages (like C, C++, Java) there is a strict declaration of variables before assigning values to them. Variables are bound to a type, meaning they can only be instantiated with objects of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dinamically typed languages, on the other hand, bind variable names to objects and the type is determined at runtime.\n",
    "It is possible to bind a name to objects of different types during the execution of the program. Python also takes care of the memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strongly typed\n",
    "\n",
    "In a weakly typed language, variables can be implicitly coerced to unrelated types, whereas in a strongly typed language they cannot, and an explicit conversion is required. In a typical weakly typed language, the number 9 and the string “9” are interchangeable, and the following sequence of statements is legal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// javascript\n",
    "var number  = 9;\n",
    "var string = \"9\";\n",
    "console.log(\"result: \", number + string); // result will be \"99\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "In a strongly typed language, on the other hand, the last statement would raise an exceptions. To avoid these exceptions, some kind of explicit type conversion would be necessary, like this:\n"

    "### General purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be used to build just about anything. The language is used for system operations, web development, server and administrative tools, deployment, scientific modeling, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, data analysis and much more. It is also used to build productivity tools, desktop apps, and games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports imperative, functional, procedural, and object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python can be obtained from the Python Software Foundation website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Typically, that involves downloading the appropriate installer for your operating system and running it on your machine.\n",
    "* Some operating systems, notably **Linux**, provide a package manager that can be run to install Python.\n",
    "* On **macOS**, the best way to install Python 3 involves installing a package manager called Homebrew\n",
    "* On mobile operating systems like **Android** and **iOS**, you can install apps that provide a Python programming environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running Python scripts. The Python shell\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interpreter is the program you’ll need to run Python code and scripts. Technically, the interpreter is a layer of software that works between your program and your computer hardware to get your code running. After installing Python, you'll be able to use the interpreter to run Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source File\n",
    "\n",
    "Python source files use the extension `.py`. In order to run a Python program, you will actually run the Python interpreter with the Python source file name as an argument. These are system commands and should be run in a command-line interpreter - e.g. **cmd** (Windows), **Terminal** (macOS, Ubuntu).\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "/usr/local/bin/python3 /path/to/script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the Python interpreter is linked to a shorter command name, like `python` or `python3`. You don't have to provide the absolute path to the source file if the file is at the current working location. Usually, you'll run a Python file like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `script.py` file you should include valid Python instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello world!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you'll notice the first line in a Python file looking like something like this `#!/usr/bin/env python3`. This is called a *shebang* and it's used to specify the path to the executable for that script. The shebang line in any script determines the script's ability to be executed like a standalone executable. So, if you place the following lines inside `script.py` and you make the file executable (`chmod +x script.py` on Unix-like systems):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/local/bin/python3                                                           \n",
    "print('Hello world!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you'll be able to directly run the file in the command-line, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "./script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python shell\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python shell or the interactive interpreter is a very powerful tool allowing developers to inspect the code and experiment with small blocks of code before moving it to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the Python shell, simply run the `python` command in a terminal. Enter any Python statement, press Enter, and the code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Python 3.7.5 (default, Nov  1 2019, 02:16:32) \n",
    "[Clang 11.0.0 (clang-1100.0.33.8)] on darwin\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> print(\"hello world\")\n",
    "hello world\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the right tool for developing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need much to start coding in Python! Any text editor will do, although it might be dificult to write the code in a plain text editor, especially when you don't have that much experience with the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, we will be using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), an integrated development environment (IDE) built for Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, many IDEs provide support for Python, so if you have another preferred IDE, check online for suitable extensions to enable Python support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to keep in mind when choosing a Python code editor / IDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Save and reload code files**: if an IDE or editor won’t let you save your work and reopen everything later, in the same state it was in when you left, it’s not much of an IDE.\n",
    "* **Syntax highlighting**: being able to quickly spot keywords, variables, and symbols in your code makes reading and understanding code much easier.\n",
    "* **Automatic code formatting**: any good editor or IDE will recognize the colon at the end of a while or for statement, and know the next line should be indented.\n",
    "* **Integrated linter / PEP8 checker**: a code editor that helps you abide the code formatting rules in Python is desirable.\n",
    "* **Debugging support**: being able to step through your code as it runs is a core feature of all IDEs and most good code editors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Library\n",
    "After installing Python on your system, you'll have access to all the functionality defined by the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). The Standard Library can be further classified in \n",
    "* built-in names (including built-in functions, constants, types, exceptions)\n",
    "* standard modules and packages\n",
    "\n",
    "All built-in names are readily available, as we've seen with the `print` built-in function above. The functions, classes and constants defined inside standard modules are available only after import (more on this later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Third-party packages\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of the Python Standard Library, you can install 3rd party packages. There is a vast collection of open-source 3rd party packages available in the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) built and maintained by the Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Package Manager (`pip`)\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` is the default package manager for Python and it is shipped with the language. It can be used to install/uninstall/search/inspect 3rd party packages. `pip` is a system program, so it should be used in the command-line interpreter (terminal). Some useful pip commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* install a package\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "* uninstall a package\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip uninstall <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "* install packages from a requirements file\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "* list installed packages in a human-friendly format\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "* list installed packages in requirements format\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip freeze\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing packages from local files\n",
    "If `pip` fails to install packages from PyPI, you have the option to first download the packages, and then install them from the local archive files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Manual download\n",
    "Go to https://pypi.org/, search for the package you need, go to the package page. In the left sidebar, access *Download files*, under *Navigation*. Download the files - any of *.whl* and *.tar.gz* will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatic download\n",
    "** This might not work if `pip install <package_name>` doesn't work.\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip download <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "OR\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip download -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Install local packages\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install  --no-index --find-links=<path_to_downloaded_files> <package_name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "OR \n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install  --no-index --find-links=<path_to_downloaded_files> -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## Isolated Python environments (`virtualenv`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why do we need virtual environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without virtual environments, `pip` will install all site packages (third party libraries) in a single location on the machine where it runs. Global site packages are available to the Python interpreter, wherever you would call it from. \n",
    "\n",
    "But let's asume you are working on two Python projects, both of which use the same third party package `common_package`, but with different versions: *ProjectA* uses `common_package=v1.0.0` and *ProjectB* uses `common_package=v2.0.0`. This is a real problem for Python since it can’t differentiate between versions in the site-packages directory. Since packages are stored according to just their name, there is no differentiation between versions. Thus, both projects, *ProjectA* and *ProjectB*, would be required to use the same version, which is unacceptable in most of the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Is a Virtual Environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `virtualenv`\n",
    "\n",
    "`virtualenv` is a tool to create isolated Python environments. Some useful `virtualenv` commands:\n",
