    "A thread is a separate flow of execution. This means that your program will have multiple things happening at once.

In CPython, multi-threading is supported by introducing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) which to prevent multiple threads from accessing the same Python object simultaneously. Only one thread can hold the GIL at a time, one thread must wait for another thread to release the GIL before running.\n",

    "A common problem that arises when working with multi-threaded programs is accessing a shared object. If threads need to modify an object, they have to make several operations: get the current value of the object, compute the new value, overwrite object with new value. Between these operations, the OS might pass the running context to another thread, which will read the same \"current\" version of the common object. When writing to the shared object, both threads will write the same value, leading to one of the computations being lost. \n",
    "\n",
    "A way to prevent this is by using a `Lock`. A `Lock` is an object that acts like a hall pass. Only one thread at a time can have the `Lock`. Any other thread that wants the `Lock` must wait until the owner of the `Lock` gives it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic functions to do this are `.acquire()` and `.release()`. A thread will call `my_lock.acquire()` to get the lock. If the lock is already held, the calling thread will wait until it is released. "
