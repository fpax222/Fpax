    "## HTTP protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called *requests* and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called *responses*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Request message\n",
    "The request message consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a request line (e.g. `GET /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1`, which requests a resource called `/images/logo.png` from the server)\n",
    "* request header fields (e.g. `Accept-Language: en`)\n",
    "* an empty line\n",
    "* an optional message body\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Request methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GET** - requests data; should only retrieve data and have no other effect.\n",
    "* **POST** - sends data; the data POSTed might be, for example, an annotation for existing resources; a message for a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or comment thread; a block of data that is the result of submitting a web form to a data-handling process; or an item to add to a database.\n",
    "* **PATCH** -  applies partial modifications to a resource.\n",
    "* **PUT** - replaces the resource at the current URL with the resource contained within the request; PUT is used to both create and update the state of a resource on the server.\n",
    "* **DELETE** - deletes the specified resource.\n",
    "* **HEAD** - asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body; useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.\n",
    "* **OPTIONS** - returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response message\n",
    "The response message consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a status line which includes the status code and reason message (e.g. `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`, which indicates that the client's request succeeded)\n",
    "* response header fields (e.g. `Content-Type: text/html`)\n",
    "* an empty line\n",
    "* an optional message body\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Status codes\n",
    "* Informational `1XX`\n",
    "* Successful `2XX`\n",
    "* Redirection `3XX`\n",
    "* Client Error `4XX`\n",
    "* Server Error `5XX`\n",

    "* Web Server: The process that interfaces with client requests. E.g. Apache, Nginx\n",
    "* WSGI Server: Web Server Gateway Inteface (WSGI) is a specification for a standardized interface between Web servers and Python Web frameworks/applications; a WSGI server is an application that interfaces web server - web application communication. E.g. Gunicorn, uWSGI, mod_wsgi\n",
    "* Database: organized collection of data. E.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle\n",
    "* Async Tasks: separate Python process(es) ready to run asynchronous tasks. E.g. Celery\n",
    "* Other external resources: caching systems, the file system\n",

    "* The `project/` directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. `mysite.urls`).\n",

    "* `project/settings.py`: Settings/configuration for this Django project.\n",
    "* `project/urls.py`: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site.\n",

    "* `app/__init__.py`: Package initialization file.\n",
    "* `app/admin.py`: A file where you can customize the administration interface.\n",
    "* `app/apps.py`: Application configuration for app.\n",

    "* `app/models.py`: Database structure definition through `Model` classes.\n",
    "* `app/tests.py`: Automated tests for the app.\n",

    "## URL dispatcher\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean, elegant URL scheme\n",
    "* Doesn’t put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp\n",
    "* Like a table of contents for your app\n",
    "* Mapping between URL patterns and your views\n",
    "* Because it’s pure Python code, it can be constructed dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample URLconf:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.urls import path\n",
    "\n",
    "from . import views\n",
    "\n",
    "urlpatterns = [\n",
    "    path('articles/2003/', views.special_case_2003),\n",

    "\n",
    "## Views\n",
    "\n",
    "A view function, or view for short, is a Python function that takes a Web request and returns a Web response. This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample view:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "def current_datetime(request):\n",

    "## Models. The ORM\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that converts database concepts to object-oriented ones.\n",

    "| Database | OOP       |\n",
    "| -------- | --------- |\n",
    "| table    | class     |\n",
    "| row      | instance  |\n",
    "| column   | attribute |\n",
    "\n",
    "A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample model:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person(models.Model):\n",
    "    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n",
    "    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Django Admin\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful parts of Django is the automatic admin interface. It reads metadata from models to provide a quick, model-centric interface where trusted users can manage content on the site. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "A template contains the static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample template:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "{% if latest_question_list %}\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    {% for question in latest_question_list %}\n",
    "        <li><a href=\"/polls/{{ question.id }}/\">{{ question.question_text }}</a></li>\n",
    "    {% endfor %}\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "{% else %}\n",
    "    <p>No polls are available.</p>\n",
    "{% endif %}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generic views\n",
    "\n",
    "Class-based views provide an alternative way to implement views as Python objects instead of functions. They do not replace function-based views, but have certain differences and advantages when compared to function-based views:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Organization of code related to specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) can be addressed by separate methods instead of conditional branching.\n",
    "* Object oriented techniques such as mixins (multiple inheritance) can be used to factor code into reusable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample class-based view:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.http import HttpResponse\n",
    "from django.views import View\n",
    "\n",
    "class GreetingView(View):\n",
    "    greeting = \"Good Day\"\n",
